        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p><b>Q: What is this?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> This site helps you to export your PoliMi™ lecture timetable in the Google Calendar App, creating an event
        for each lecture. The events are set with a weekly recurrence period so, in case your professor changes the lectures hours,
        you can easily edit all the info for that lecture from the Google App.</p>
        <p><b>Q: What is PoliMi™?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> It's a Univ... Wait, how the hell did you get here??</p>
        <p><b>Q: Do I need a Google account?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> Yes. The popup that appears after hitting the "Authorize" button will give an option to create an
            account if you don't have one.</p>
        <p><b>Q: Where can I find the timetables?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> Go to the <a href="https://www.polimi.it/onlineservices">Polimi Online Services</a>, find the
            <i>Lecture Timetables</i> link and then you'll have to select the <i>Text Timetable</i> tab. <b>NOTE:</b>
            this will probably take long time to do from the mobile version of the Online Services, so I <u>strongly</u>
            suggest to use the Desktop version.</p>
        <p><b>Q: What does the <u>create new calendar</u> option mean?</b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> Google Calendar gives you a <i>primary calendar</i> and the possibility to add other <i>secondary</i> ones.
            By default, this site creates a new calendar named "PoliMi" and puts the events there, but if you prefer
            to have a single calendar uncheck that option and you'll find all of your lectures in the primary calendar.
            Note that you can still move the events between your secondary and primary calendars, so this is not a binding
            option anyway.</p>
        <p><b>Q: How can I contribute?</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>Hey, thanks! This site is quite simple and I don't think it needs any particular attention,
            but if you have any suggestion or a bug to report you can <u><a href="https://github.com/rigowave/PoliCalendars/issues/new">open a new Issue on GitHub</a></u>.
            All the code is accessible from there. Pull requests are also <b>very</b> appreciated, in case you find any typo
            or want to contribute to the site in any way (for example, by providing an Italian translation).</p>
        <p><b>Q: I don't attend lectures anyway.</b></p>
        <p><b>A: </b>That's not a question.</p>
